# Classification

## Naïve Bayes

**Naïve Bayes classification** relies on the method that describes the probability of an event in light of additional information.

The classification is based on the following question:

> "Based on prior evidence, what is the most likely class of a new unlabeled instance?" [@pml]

To make use of prior evidence, the method utilizes the concept of the _conditional probability_.

:::{#def-clssf-1}
_Bayes formula_ for conditional probability.

$$
P(A|B)=\frac{P(A)\times{P(B|A)}}{P(B)}
$$

:::

:::{#def-clssf-2}
Conditional probability with multiple predictors, describing the relationship between dependent events _A_ and _S_, where _S_ is an _n_-term set of independent events based on the _Naïve Bayes_ assumption.

$$
P(A|S)=\frac{P(A)\times{P(s_1|A)}\times{P(s_2|A)}\times{\dots}\times{P(s_n|A)}}{P(s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n)}
$$
